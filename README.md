# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here: https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer

## Getting Started

- Follow steps inside the snek server repo to run the server side
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command.

Your snake begins in a random location in the playing field, as will a piece of 'food'. Use: 

W to move up, 
S to move down, 
A to move left, and
D to move right.

Use keys 1 - 9 to tell your cometitors a) why you're so awesome or b) why their snake moves are numbered. 

Stay away from your own tail and the walls!

Have fun!
